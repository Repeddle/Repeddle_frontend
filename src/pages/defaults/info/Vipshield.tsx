          new generation of conscious fashion thinkers in AFRICA by creating a
          unique platform our generation will find very useful, keeping their
          creative minds and spirit alive, turning their creativity as an income
          stream for them, while doing right by our planet and environment,
          making sustainable living by selling and thrifting secondhand fashion.

        <p className="mt-4">
          To support the business growth and reward the effort of our thrift
          community that buy and sell using our platforms, we have created a{" "}
          <b className="text-orange-color"> REPEDDLE VIP SHIELD </b>
          for them to showcase on their profile. Our VIP shield can only be
          earned when you become <b>(TOP SELLER)</b> an active user.

        <p className="mt-4">
          <b>Did you know?</b> By extending the life of a piece of clothing by
          extra 9-months, you are reducing its waste, water and carbon footprint
          by up-to 30%. These means; by Reselling, Upcycling or thrifting a
          garment, you are prolonging a textile lifespan, giving it chance to
          live longer while reducing textile carbon footprint on the planet and
          saving our environment. We hope these will minimize the emergency of
          global environmental crisis we and the planet is currently faced.
