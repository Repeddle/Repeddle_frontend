      Want free delivery? Re:Bundle gives you the opportunity to pay for one delivery (the 1st purchase) 
      and get free delivery on the rest items you purchase from the same seller within two (2) hours window after the 1st checkout.
      </p>

      <h2 className="font-medium text-xl lg:text-2xl">
       How It Works:
      </h2>
      <section className="mb-6">
       <ol className="mb-4 pl-8 list-decimal list-outside text-justify">
            <li className="text-justify">Purchase a product using a prefer delivery method made available by the seller.</li>
            <li className="text-justify">After the 1st successful purchase, a two hours’ time window is activated for you to make additional 
                purchase from the same seller and get free delivery on the products you bought between that two hours, 
                this means you don’t pay delivery fee for products you purchase when Re:Bundle is active within two hours after your 1st purchase.
            </li>
            <li className="text-justify">
            If you did not see Re:Bundle on the seller’s profile or on checkout, that means the seller has not activated Re:Bundle. 
            You may simply message the seller using the message me button on the seller’s profile and ask them to activate Re:Bundle 
            before you complete the checkout, as you want to purchase more products from them using Re:Bundle.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <h2 className="font-medium text-xl lg:text-2xl">
       Attention
      </h2>
      <section className="mb-6">
       <ol className="mb-4 pl-8 list-decimal list-outside text-justify">
            <li>
            In order for the seller to pack your Re:Bundle purchase, all your Re:Bundle purchases must be able to fit into the courier bag or box, if not, 
            it may attract extra delivery charge.
            </li>
            <li>For the Re:Bundle option to be completely successful, you need to ensure completing your order and checkout within the two hours window after 
                the 1st purchase from the same seller. This applies whenever Re:Bundle is activated or whenever you wish to use Re:Bundle.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you wish to use Re:Bundle and you don’t see the option activated on the seller’s profile or when checking out, remember you’re very free to 
            message the seller and ask them to activate Re:Bundle for you. Sellers are always happy to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
            The free delivery elapses after two hours you made the first purchase, meaning Re:Bundle window closes after two hours from the 1st complete purchase checkout.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
    </div>
